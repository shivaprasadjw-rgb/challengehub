To browse your website locally, you need to run the development server first. Here's how:

## 🚀 **Start Local Development Server**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory**
```bash
cd C:\Users\Shiva\Desktop\ISTL2\ISTL2
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies (if not already done)**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 4: Open Browser**
Once the server starts, you'll see output like:
```
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Network:      http://192.168.x.x:3000
```

## 🌐 **Local URLs**

- **Main URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Alternative:** `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

##    **Available Pages**

Once running locally, you can access:

- **Homepage:** `http://localhost:3000/`
- **Tournaments:** `http://localhost:3000/tournaments`
- **Admin:** `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- **Organizer:** `http://localhost:3000/organizer`
- **Register:** `http://localhost:3000/register`
- **About:** `http://localhost:3000/about`
- **Contact:** `http://localhost:3000/contact`

## ⚙️ **Environment Setup**

Make sure you have a `.env.local` file with:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## 🔧 **If You Get Errors**

1. **Port already in use:** Try `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
2. **Database connection issues:** Check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
3. **Dependencies missing:** Run `npm install` again

## 🎯 **Quick Start Command**

```bash
cd C:\Users\Shiva\Desktop\ISTL2\ISTL2 && npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser!
