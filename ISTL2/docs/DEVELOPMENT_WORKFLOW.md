# Development Workflow with Issue Documentation

This guide explains how to use the issue documentation system to maintain stable development workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

The issue documentation system helps you:
- ✅ Avoid re-solving the same problems
- ✅ Build confidence in your development workflow
- ✅ Maintain functional stability over time
- ✅ Learn from past solutions

## 📋 How to Use This System

### When You Encounter an Issue

1. **Don't Panic** - This is normal in development
2. **Document First** - Start a new issue entry using the template
3. **Solve the Problem** - Work through the solution
4. **Update Documentation** - Complete the issue entry
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure the fix works
6. **Add Prevention Measures** - Document how to avoid this in the future

### Quick Documentation Process

#### Step 1: Create Quick Entry
Add to the table in `ISSUE_LOG_AND_FIXES.md`:
```markdown
| 2025-01-12 | PostgreSQL Enum Error | Complete table recreation | prisma/schema.prisma | "resolve this error" | ✅ Resolved |
```

#### Step 2: Add Detailed Entry
Use the template from `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` to create a comprehensive entry.

#### Step 3: Update Prevention Checklist
Add any new prevention measures to the checklist.

## 🔧 Best Practices

### For Issue Documentation

1. **Be Specific** - Include exact error messages and code snippets
2. **Include Context** - Explain what you were trying to do
3. **Document Steps** - Write down every step of the solution
4. **Test Results** - Include what tests you ran to verify the fix
5. **Add Tags** - Use relevant tags for easy searching

### For Cursor AI Prompts

1. **Be Descriptive** - Explain the full context of the problem
2. **Include Error Messages** - Paste the exact error text
3. **Mention Files** - Specify which files are involved
4. **Ask for Prevention** - Request suggestions for avoiding this in the future

### Example Good Prompt
```
"I'm getting a PostgreSQL error when trying to query tournaments. The error is: 'operator does not exist: text = "TournamentStatus"'. This happens in my tournaments API route. I've attached the error logs. Can you help me fix this and suggest how to prevent it in the future?"
```

## 📚 Documentation Structure

```

## 🔗 Integration with Cursor AI

### Effective Prompts for Documentation
- "Help me document this solution for future reference"
- "What prevention measures should I implement?"
- "How can I avoid this issue in the future?"
- "Create a checklist for this type of problem"

### Using Documentation in Prompts
- "I had a similar issue before, here's what I documented..."
- "Based on my issue log, this looks like..."
- "I want to prevent this issue from happening again..."
